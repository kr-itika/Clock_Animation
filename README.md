#3D Clock Animation

This project is a procedurally modeled and animated 3D wall clock developed as part of the Graphics & Visual Computing (GVC) coursework. The objective was to apply core computer graphics concepts and transform them into a clear and visually engaging animation using Autodesk Maya and Python scripting.

The clock is created entirely from basic geometric primitives, and its animation is driven by expression-based, frame-driven logic instead of manual keyframes. The hour, minute, and second hands rotate clockwise with accurate relative speeds, producing smooth and realistic synchronization. Basic materials, lighting, and shadows are applied while keeping the scene clean and well-organized.

🛠 Tech Stack
Autodesk Maya (Educational Version)
Python (maya.cmds)
Arnold Renderer

⚙️ Techniques & Concepts
Procedural modeling using polygon primitives
Expression-driven animation logic
Geometric transformations and pivot alignment
Hierarchical object structuring
Lighting, materials, and shadow rendering

🎯 Outcome
The final animation demonstrates how logical thinking, scripting, and graphics fundamentals work together to create a structured and realistic visual result. The project is designed to be easy to understand and explain during evaluations, interviews, or portfolio reviews.

🧩 What I Built
A 3D animated wall clock with a golden frame, black clock face, white numbers, and three animated hands rotating clockwise at correct speeds to simulate real-time motion.

▶️ How to Run the Project
Open Autodesk Maya and launch the Script Editor
Switch to the Python tab
Copy and run the code from clock_30.py
Press Play to view the animation

🧠 Challenges Faced
The main challenges involved correcting the rotation direction of the clock hands and preventing animation resets during timeline loops, which were resolved by using frame-based expressions instead of keyframes.

✅ Original Work
This project is entirely my original work, implemented using Maya’s built-in Python API without any external plugins or third-party tools.
